## Step 3: Install Windows Vista Pre Activated ISO 49
 
The final step is to install Windows Vista Pre Activated ISO 49 on your PC using the bootable USB drive or DVD that you created. To do this, you will need to boot your PC from the USB or DVD instead of your hard drive. This might require changing some settings in your BIOS or UEFI menu, depending on your PC model and manufacturer.
 
To access the BIOS or UEFI menu, you will need to press a certain key when your PC starts up, such as F2, F10, F12, Esc, Del, etc. The exact key varies depending on your PC brand and model, so you might need to check your user manual or search online for more information.
