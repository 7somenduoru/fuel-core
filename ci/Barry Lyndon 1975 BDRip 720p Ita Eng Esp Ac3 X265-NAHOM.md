One of the most remarkable aspects of Barry Lyndon 1975 is its cinematography. The film was shot by John Alcott, who collaborated with Kubrick on several films. Alcott used natural light sources such as sunlight, moonlight, and candles to create a realistic and atmospheric look. He also used special lenses that were developed by NASA for the Apollo missions. These lenses had a very fast aperture of f/0.7, which allowed them to capture low-light scenes with minimal grain and noise.
 
Another notable feature of Barry Lyndon 1975 is its music. The film has a rich and varied soundtrack that includes classical pieces by Bach, Handel, Mozart, Schubert, and Vivaldi. The music is used to enhance the mood and tone of the film, as well as to contrast the elegance and brutality of the 18th century. The film also features an original score by Leonard Rosenman, who won an Oscar for his adaptation and orchestration of the classical music.
 
A third element that makes Barry Lyndon 1975 a masterpiece is its acting. The film has a large and talented cast that brings the characters to life. Ryan O'Neal gives a nuanced and charismatic performance as Barry Lyndon, who undergoes a dramatic transformation from a naive and impulsive youth to a cynical and disillusioned man. Marisa Berenson delivers a subtle and graceful portrayal of Lady Lyndon, who suffers silently from her husband's neglect and infidelity. Patrick Magee is excellent as Lord Bullingdon, who despises Barry and challenges him to a duel. Hardy KrÃ¼ger is also impressive as Captain Potzdorf, who helps Barry in his career and becomes his friend.
