# How to Install GaussView 5 on Linux
 
GaussView 5 is a graphical interface for Gaussian, a popular software for computational chemistry. It allows users to create and edit Gaussian input files, run Gaussian calculations, and visualize the results. GaussView 5 is available for Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux platforms.
 
In this article, we will show you how to install GaussView 5 on Linux using a torrent file. A torrent file is a small file that contains information about a larger file that can be downloaded from multiple sources. To use a torrent file, you need a torrent client, such as Transmission or qBittorrent.

## What is Gaussian?
 
Gaussian is a software package for computational chemistry that can perform a variety of calculations on molecules and reactions. Gaussian can calculate molecular structures, energies, frequencies, thermodynamic properties, spectroscopic properties, reaction pathways, and more. Gaussian can also perform quantum mechanical calculations using various methods and basis sets.
 
Gaussian was developed by John Pople and his group at Carnegie Mellon University in the 1970s. Since then, Gaussian has been continuously updated and improved by a team of developers and contributors. Gaussian is widely used by chemists, physicists, biologists, and engineers for research and education.
  
## What is GaussView?
 
GaussView is a graphical interface for Gaussian that makes it easier to use and understand. GaussView allows users to create and edit Gaussian input files using a graphical editor that shows the molecular structure and properties. GaussView also allows users to run Gaussian calculations from within the interface and monitor the progress and status of the calculations. GaussView can display the results of Gaussian calculations using various graphical tools, such as molecular orbitals, electrostatic potentials, vibrational modes, reaction profiles, and more.
 
GaussView was developed by Semichem, Inc. in collaboration with Gaussian, Inc. GaussView is designed to work seamlessly with Gaussian and to provide a user-friendly and intuitive interface for computational chemistry. GaussView can also be used as a standalone molecular viewer and editor for other file formats.
